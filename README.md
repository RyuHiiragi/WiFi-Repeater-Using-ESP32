# WiFi Repeater Using ESP32

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building a WiFi repeater using the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 acts as both a Wi-Fi client and an access point (AP), enabling it to receive and rebroadcast a Wi-Fi signal, effectively extending the coverage area <button class="citation-flag" data-index="2">. This project is ideal for improving Wi-Fi connectivity in areas with weak signals, such as large homes, offices, or remote locations.

## Overview
The WiFi repeater uses the ESP32's dual-mode Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to an existing Wi-Fi network and rebroadcast it as a new network. This setup improves Wi-Fi coverage in areas with weak signals, making it a cost-effective solution for extending network range <button class="citation-flag" data-index="4">. The ESP32's ability to act as both a client and an access point makes it an excellent choice for this application.

## Components Used
To build this WiFi repeater, you will need the following components:
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **5V USB Power Adapter**
- **External Antenna (Optional)**
- **Protective Enclosure (Optional)**

---

## System Dimensions
For an ideal WiFi repeater:
- **Height**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Width**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Length**: 10â€“15 cm

These dimensions ensure that the system is compact yet spacious enough to house all components.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow these steps to assemble your WiFi repeater:
1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable for programming.
2. Optionally, install an external antenna to improve signal strength.
3. Power the ESP32 using a USB power adapter or battery pack.
4. Place the repeater in an area where it can receive the primary Wi-Fi signal and broadcast it effectively.
